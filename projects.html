        <p>
            Last semester, we were tasked with creating a database to store information for a topic of our choice. I decided to create mine <br>
            for a website called <a href="auctionexport.com">auctionexport.com</a>. The site is used to purhcase cars from abroad and import them. <br>
            You can also put your own cars up for sale. As the domain suggests, there are auctions where users bid on cars. The car goes to the user <br>
            with the highest bid at the end of the session.
