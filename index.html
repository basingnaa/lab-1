        <h1>Anthony Nwintiribu Basingnaa</h1>

        <p>
            My name is <strong>Anthony Basingnaa</strong> and I am a student of <strong>Ashesi University</strong>. I am taking <strong>Computer Science</strong> as a major and it
            entails being conversant with programming and programming languages, as well as how to apply them to solve real world
            problems. I will be graduating in 2022 and after school, I am interested in being either a <strong>Game Developer</strong> or a Software 
            Engineer. I am a big fan of sports, especially basketball. I also enjoy watching series and movies, and going out with 
            friends. I was born and raised in <em>Accra</em>, but my traditional hometown is <em>Serekpere</em> in the Upper West Region.
